# Data Science Salaries Prediction
The objective of this project is to analyze variables that potentially affect the salaries of data science professionals, with data obtained from the [Data Science Salaries](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arnabchaki/data-science-salaries-2023) dataset from Kaggle. Utilizing statistical concepts such as multiple linear regression and forward selection algorithm, an inferential analysis will first be conducted to infer the relationship between the variables and salary (USD), followed by building a predictive model to predict one's salary based on said variables. By examining factors such as experience level, remote work ratio and company size, it is possible to both understand the impact of these variables on salaries and identify key predictors.
